# TP_Android

This is our last Android TP: 
During this lesson we have learnt many interesting things : 

RecyclerView : The view holder objects are managed by an adapter, which you create by extending RecyclerView.Adapter. 

To feed all your data to the list, you must extend the RecyclerView.Adapter class. This object creates views for items, and replaces the content of some of the views with new data items when the original item is no longer visible.

ViewHolder : it describes an item view and metadata about its place within the RecyclerView.
